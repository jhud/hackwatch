# hackwatch
Want to run your Arduino code anywhere, any time? How about running a webserver from your wrist? This is a smartwatch running on the ESP32 + Arduino + 0.96' OLED (color or monochrome). Designed to run on cheap boards that have inbuilt LiPo battery circuitry and an OLED screen. It makes for quite a chunky watch, but the "always on" glow looks very cool, and a 500mAH battery currently lasts 10+ hours without any optimisation. The whole prototype was built for $12.

Currently, the code uses your WiFi to sync with an NTP server, then show the time and date. I'll improve this project as I need features and find time.

The "flash" button on the GPIO0 of the development board is repurposed as a function button for the watch.

## Features
 - Flashlight, Stopwatch, Timer, Wifi Scan, UV Sensor with daily exposure graph
 - BLE connection to Apple devices, with message notifications
 - Hardcoded calendar functionality, which will remind you when you need to catch buses, etc.
 - Screen off button, goes into sleep mode
 - Switch between color or B&W display on the application level, via a high-level UI interface.


# Setup

## Installation

Install the following dependencies:
 - Time (from Arduino library manager)
 - git clone https://github.com/mgo-tec/ESP32_SSD1331 (for the color SSD1331 display)


You need to create a file called "secrets.h" which has your WiFi SSID and password:

const char ssid[] = "my access point";  //  your network SSID (name)
const char pass[] = "MyPassword12345";       // your network password

If you have an SSD1306 monochrome display, remove the #define COLOR_SCREEN. If you have an SSD1331 color display, set that define. Make sure you have the correct pins set in layout.cpp.

# Fabrication
The SVG file can be printed out, and the pieces cut from 1.5mm rubber. For attaching rubber, here are the methods tried (1 star fail, 5 star excellent):
 - Stitching with nylon thread *****
 - Double-sided tape ***
 - Vulcanising rubber cement **
 - Electrical tape **
 - Hot glue *
 The best method was to stick pieces with double-sided tape, and then stitch any load-bearing joins.

# Major tasks yet to do:
- Big refactor of messy prototype code
- Reduce power consumption (i.e. deep sleep when not changing display)
- Piezo chime or vibrate
